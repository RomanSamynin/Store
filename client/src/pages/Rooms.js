                                <h3>Whether it's your first home or your fifth, it's still fun to decorate. If you're a first-time homeowner, you might not yet have your personal design style figured out. If you've decorated before, maybe you feel like changing things up with a different look or updating your style to something fresher. Regardless of your situation, here are a few of the most popular home decor design styles to consider.</h3>
                                <h1>Contemporary</h1>
                                <h3>The style we know as contemporary became popular in the second half of the 20th century. This style is characterized by soft, rounded lines. There will be a lot of neutral elements, with pops of bold color. Think of a room that's mostly black and white, but has a red area rug and throw pillows on the couch. Furniture will have a more back-to-basics feel in terms of line, shape, and form. It's a simple, clean look without much embellishment or ornate details.</h3>
                                <h1>Farmhouse</h1>
                                <h3>The rustic, farmhouse style has become quite popular in recent years thanks to Joanna Gaines from HGTV's home remodeling show "Fixer Upper". This style involves a lot of wood elements and evokes a cozy, comfortable feeling in your home. It is a practical style that relies on easy-to-acquire materials, often in neutral colors such as white or gray. Most pieces tend to have a distressed look, whether natural or man-made.</h3>
                                <h1>Modern</h1>
                                <h3>A modern design style will have clean and crisp, yet sharp and stark lines. Color choices will tend to be more plain. Frequently used materials include glass, metal, and steel. Modern furniture tends to be fairly simple. A subset of this design style is called mid-century modern. It is reminiscent of the 1950s and '60s. Essentially, if the piece would look natural on a "Mad Men" set, it's probably part of the mid-century modern design style.</h3>
                                <h1>Traditional</h1>
                                <h3>A traditional look is more easy to come by, as it is essentially however you want to decorate your home. It can include comfortable furniture, classic designs, and casual d√©cor. This style tends towards warmer colors with symmetrical lines. It is a popular design style in today's homes due to its flexibility and acceptance of most pieces.</h3>
